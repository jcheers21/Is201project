    I am going to tell the story of when I decided I wanted to go to nail school.
    It was the start of my junior year of highschool and I went to go get my nails 
    done for the first day of school. As I was getting them done, I realized that 
    I could probably do them myself if I really tried. So once again, I went to get 
    them done a few weeks later, but this time was different. I paid very close attention
    to what they were doing exactly. Then, after that set had grown out, I attempted to 
    do them myself. It took me a very long time, but i did it. One of my classmates noticed 
    and asked if I could do hers. Over the next year, I grew a love for doing nails. I built
    a clientele, and then decided that I wanted to do this as an actual career. So I decided
    to go to school.

    <span class="bold italics" >Nail School </span> <br>
    Oh my goodness, where do I even begin. It all started when I moved out FIVE days after 
    my high school graduation. I was terrified for what was to come, but I packed up my stuff and 
    moved from Idaho to Utah. I started nail school at the beginning of June and then I graduated 
    in the middle of August. So it was about 2 months for me. I loved absolutely every single thing 
    about school. I would have class 3 times per week and for the first 5 weeks we were learning something
    new each day. Then it was time to take real clients. This was so fun and gave me so much experience.
    Lastly, after all of the "school work" was finished, we had to take 2 state board tests. After I 
    passed both of those, I was finally able to get my long awaited license. 
    I absolutely loved nail school so much. 
    It was one of the best experiences I have ever had.

    <span class="bold italics" >Life as a Nail Tech </span> <br>
    Graduating and jumping into my career at such a young age was very scary for me. Before school
    I didn't realize how much work went into creating and starting a business. Luckily,
    I had the best instructors that were able to guide me along the way. In order to start working,
    I had to find a space to rent, get my LLC, get my business license, and last 
    get insurance and anything else product wise I needed. After I did that, I was able to start work. I 
    was so nervous because I didn't think I would get any clients, but after lots of prayer and faith, 
    I gained some of the most amazing clients. I work around 20 hours per week which ranges from
    5-10 clients per week. It is seriously the most amazing job. I get to make my own schedule, set my own 
    prices, and talk to girls all day long. I love it so much.
